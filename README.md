# Auditr

Auditr is an AI-based assignment grading co-pilot, built to assist teachers.

This project uses an LLM-powered grading engine to provide feedback to students based on provided criteria and task details such that teachers can get non-biased guidance and feedback to assist the process of grading assignments. The project attempts to solve the problem of marking fatigue plaguing teachers' judgement, or just to provide a second eye.
